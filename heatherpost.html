                        <p> In relationships individuals with BPD may struggle maintaining stable connections due to their intense and fluctuating emotions. They may also have difficulties with communication, boundaries and trust. This can lead to a cycle of idealisation and devaluation where they may initially idolise their partners and then later devalue them. People with BPD may also engage in impulsive behaviours such as substance abuse, spending sprees or reckless driving. They may have a fear of abandonment and may react strongly to perceived threats of rejection, which can lead to clingy behaviour or outbursts of anger. To maintain healthy relationships with someone with BPD, communication is key. Partners should establish clear boundaries and communicate their needs effectively. It’s also important to validate their emotions without necessarily validating their behaviour. It’s important to note that while BPD can be a challenging condition to manage, people with this disorder can have fulfilling relationships with supportive partners who are willing to work with them to build a strong foundation of trust, understanding and communication. </p>

                        <p>	The video is a concise overview of the symptoms and diagnostic criteria for borderline personality disorder. The video explains BPD is characterised by a pervasive instability in a person’s mood, behaviour and self image, which can lead to impulsive and self destructive behaviour. People with BPD often struggle with intense and unstable relationships and may experience chronic feelings of emptiness or a fear of abandonment. This video also notes that BPD is often misdiagnosed or stigmatised and encourages viewers to seek professional help if they believe they may be experiencing symptoms of the disorder. Overall, the video provides a helpful introduction to BPD for those who may be unfamiliar with the disorder, and emphasises the importance of understanding and supporting those who struggle with it.</p>
