                        <p>	In this interview I will ask about the personal experiences of Kiley, a student at Michigan State University, who was diagnosed with  BPD in 2021 but has been living with it for much of her life. I would like to add a TRIGGER WARNING as topics covered in this include mentions of extreme emotions, suicidal ideation, substance abuse, depression, anxiety.</p>
                        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Hi how are you, please introduce yourself and tell us a little bit about yourself!</p>
                        <p>Hi! I am Kiley, a student here at MSU. I am doing really good, a bit stressed because of finals though. I enjoy all things creative, and I am actually super big on mental health awareness, especially here at MSU.</p>
                        <p style="font-weight: bold;">How do you refer to yourself as someone diagnosed with BPD, do you use Language like “I suffer from BPD”, “I am a survivor of BPD”, or do you just say “I am diagnosed with BPD”?</p>
                        <p>I just refer to myself as someone with BPD or someone who is borderline. However, I have never been one to get upset at other “labels”. But it definitely depends on the person!</p>
                        <p style="font-weight: bold;">What has your day-to-day life been like since your diagnosis and is that largely different from what it was before?</p>
                        <p>After my diagnosis last year it felt like my day “made sense” finally. I had always struggled with my emotions, but my diagnosis was like the final relief. For me, I felt like I was going crazy, that I was crazy, until I finally got diagnosed. Having a name to my struggle has been really good in my healing process.</p>
                        <p style="font-weight: bold;">According to an article on Mind.uk, one of the many difficulties of BPD is getting the diagnosis with many misdiagnosis being other disorders like: Bipolar Disorder, Complex Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (C-PTSD), Depression, Anxiety, and more. Was this true for your experience getting your diagnosis?</p>
                        <p>In a way, yes. I had been in therapy for awhile, on-and-off… I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder at a very young age, so it felt like that “made sense” for awhile. It was not until my childhood doctor asked me to ask my psychiatrist about a Bipolar diagnosis, when I became aware of BPD in college. Bipolar runs in my family, so it felt like that was what I had. I am glad my psychiatrist at the time ran through all the possibilities outside of Bipolar as well. Because all along it was not Bipolar, but rather Borderline!</p>
                        <p style="font-weight: bold;">What are the hardest parts you are comfortable sharing about having BPD?</p>
                        <p>The hardest parts for me is the emotional exhaustion. Imagine stressful days times 10. I cannot remember a day where I have not gone through every emotion: extreme anger/splitting, depression/suicidal thoughts and ideation, intense anxiety, unimaginable happiness and excitement. It takes a toll on me, and sometimes I just stay in bed. It isn’t the most glamorous. The days I don’t stay in bed, I might partake in “risky” behaviors. Substance Abuse has been a huge issue for me in the past. Sometimes you do anything to just feel “alive”. I used to have to ask questions like, “is this reality or is this my perceived and imagined reality?” It is not easy not knowing.</p>
                        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Are there any strengths that come with having BPD?</p>
                        <p>It depends on the individual for sure. For me personally, I have tried to find weird “positives” out of it. Since I feel emotions more intensely than a neurotypical person, I try to utilize my emotions for “good”. For example, I have a lovely boyfriend, and I care about him so deeply. I do not know if anyone who is not Borderline could possibly understand the level of love and care of a favorite person. The same goes for my friendships as well. They are my lifeline, and I try to always show them that through my emotions and feelings.</p>
                        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Is there any other information about BPD you wish people knew?</p>
                        <p>That there is many “reasons” for the diagnosis. There is no one “clear cut” answer. I feel like when there is intense diagnoses, people want to assume exactly why the person is the way that they are…</p>
                        <p style="font-weight: bold;">What are some easy things people could do to better accommodate for those with BPD?</p>
                        <p>Patience. I am registered with RCPD here at MSU, and knowing they will help me if anything has been difficult for me has been extremely reassuring. CAPS has been extremely helpful as well. I think having patience for us has been something I needed. I am glad I have found people who give me the amount of patience I need… Cause trust me, I know it is not easy.</p>
                        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Finally, are there any resources or organizations you would like to mention?</p>
                        <p>Firstly, I would love to suggest <a href="https://www.nami.org/About-Mental-Illness/Mental-Health-Conditions/Borderline-Personality-Disorder/Support#:~:text=Contact%20the%20NAMI%20HelpLine%20at,you%20may%20have%20about%20BPD">NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Health).</a> They have a wonderful section about how to help yourself and start your healing process for people with BPD. However, I would even recommend for those who feel emotions intensely and want to “understand” themselves better. They also have a section called, “Helping a Family Member or Friend” that I highly recommend anyone who has a BPD loved one.</p>
                        <p>Outside of that source, healing is not linear. That is something I have to tell myself often. I recommend for those with BPD (and those who may be struggling with other mental health issues) to check out DBT. DBT is Dialectical Behavior Therapy and it is often used for people with BPD. DBT is a form of therapy I first started using when I was first diagnosed. I will be honest, it is a lot of work. But again, healing is not linear! You have to want to better yourself. Here is some links to learn more about DBT!</p>
                        <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/DBT%C2%AE-Skills-Training-Manual-Second/dp/1462516998">DBT Skills Training Manual Second Edition (Amazon)</a></p>
                        <p><a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/22838-dialectical-behavior-therapy-dbt">Cleveland Clinic</a></p>
                        <p><a href="https://dialecticalbehaviortherapy.com/">https://dialecticalbehaviortherapy.com/</a></p>
                        <p>	For more interviews on the individual experiences of people with BPD I recommend checking out <a href="https://youtu.be/MkY7P5gtGww">this video</a>, as it contains more interviews done by Anthony Padilla. I do feel a further trigger warning is important as topics in that video touch on things such as, self harm, suicidal thoughts and actions, and more.</p>
                        <p>	The article I used to research BPD in order to better form questions for this interview was <a href="https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/types-of-mental-health-problems/borderline-personality-disorder-bpd/for-friends-and-family/">"Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD): For Friends and Family"</a> on <a href="https://www.mind.org.uk/">https://www.mind.org.uk/</a>.</p>
