                        <h2>Borderline Personality Disorder</h2>
                        <p>	People with Borderline Personality Disorder, or BPD, have a much more intense experience of life, especially their emotions. People with BPD experience basic emotions like sadness, anger, and anxiety that a person without BPD would, at a much more intense level. This difference in experience often makes some of their reactions to those without BPD seem “unreasonable” and “overdramatic” thus feeding into the stigma around the disorder. Some common neurological coping mechanisms seen within BPD are dissociation as well as manic episodes which both set in rapidly and can last anywhere from 5 minutes to 5 days. People with BPD may also be seen as “clingy”, this is due to the lack of a strong sense of self found with BPD which is usually a result of a lack of attachment in childhood, something that is an overall cause for the disorder. All this information and more can be found in this very well constructed video essay by Dr. Alok Kanojia who is a licensed Psychiatrist:</p>

                        <h2>Post Traumatic Stress Disorder</h2>
                        <p>	Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, like BPD, is a disorder resulting from traumatic events. With PTSD these events can be either experienced or witnessed by someone to cause them to develop PTSD. PTSD often makes day to day life harder much like BPD but it does it in very different ways. PTSD often causes flashbacks to the traumatic event that caused it which can mentally paralyze someone suffering from them. Due to this people with PTSD often try to avoid things that will cause this which may make them appear apathetic and distant to those around them.
